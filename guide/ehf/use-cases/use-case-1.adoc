= Use case 1 – Supporting documents available in open databases

For tenders above the threshold, this is probably the most typical use case, where the contracting authority require the tenderer to which it has decided to award the contract, to submit up-to-date supporting documents. But, contracting authorities can not ask for supporting documents if these are available in open databases, or if the contracting authority already possesses these documents. See {link-directive}, Article 59, paragraph 4.

In this scenario, the economic operator has sent an ESPD Response as part of the tender documents, and the contracting authority need to check if it already possesses some of the supporting documents. For the rest of the supporting documents, the contracting authority is obliged to get these from open databases if such exist, and then ask the economic operator to provide the rest.

= Use case 2 – Restricted procedure or need to check some or all of the supporting documents

In a restricted procedure the contracting authority will usually require submission of the supporting documents at the moment of selection of the candidates. There can also be other reasons why the contracting authority wants to check some or all of the supporting documents before the evaluation phase. See {link-directive}, Article 65, 59-4 and note 84.

In this scenario, the economic operator has sent an ESPD Response as part of the tender documents or, and the contracting authority need to check if it already possesses some of the supporting documents. For the rest of the supporting documents, the contracting authority is obliged to get these from open databases if such exist, and then ask all the economic operators to provide the rest.

= Use case 3 – Contract phase

In this scenario, the economic operator has an ongoing contract with the contracting authority. The contract states that the contracting authority at any time can check if the economic operator still meets the qualification criteria. The contracting authority retrieves the supporting documents from the open databases and check them accordingly.
